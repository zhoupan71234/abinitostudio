What is AbinitoStudio?
====================
AbinitoStudio is software for first-principles calculations. 
It is based on Python 3 and therefore does not support Python 2. 
The software integrates three main functions: 
3D visualization of POSCAR atomic structure files, 
ssh remote command casting, and post-processing of first-principles calculation results such as 
2D plotting of energy bands and projected energy bands.
