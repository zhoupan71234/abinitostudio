Example
####################

====================
File-¡¾Open POSCAR¡¿
====================
Open a POSCAR file and display it in the 3D area.
As shown in the figure, [examples]- [POSCAR] is opened.

.. image:: images/02.jpg

====================
File-¡¾Build structure¡¿
====================
The input of lattice parameters: first input the space group of the material, 
and then select the input mode [coordinate] or [matrix]. In [coordinate] mode, 
you need to enter the length of the three sides and the degrees of the three included angles; 
in [matrix] mode, you need to enter a matrix. Finally, 
choose the coordinate type [Fractional] or [Cartesian].

====================
File-¡¾Close¡¿
====================
Exit the application.

====================
Calculation-¡¾VASP¡¿
====================
After setting, perform scf calculation.
Click [VASP]-[scf] to bring up the input panel, enter the necessary INCAR and KPOINTS files for relax and scf respectively, 
as well as the POTCAR path, element order, calculation path, VASP command and the kernel number of the task, 
click Start Calculation to finish casting the task from the windows side. 
The VASP_files folder is generated on the desktop by default. These input information you can save in [default]-[scf.txt], 
next time when you input, you can click [Get information] to fill in directly.
The operation of [scf_noncal], [band], [band_noncal], [DOS], [phonon], 
and [wannier] is the same as the use of [scf].

.. image:: images/04.jpg

.. image:: images/05.jpg

====================
Calculation-¡¾Pyxtal¡¿
====================
Generate a POSCAR file, the default save path is the desktop new [VASP_files] folder, 
choose a type you want to save [POSCAR] or [cif].

.. image:: images/06.jpg

====================
Plot-¡¾Bands¡¿
====================
[Plot]-[Bands] Then select the [EIGENVAL_CdCl] file in the [examples] folder, 
and input the relevant parameters in the dialog.
The Fermi level of CdCl2 is -3.172 eV, and there are three symmetry points, 
namely M, §¤, and K. [High symmetry point] input a list, each element is a string, 
support Latex syntax. The Y-axis parameters have the minimum and maximum values, 
the label of the Y-axis, and the label font size. Title parameters include title and font size. 
You can also set the thickness of the dashed and solid lines. 
Finally, there are the thickness of the coordinates, the direction and thickness of the scale, 
and the size of the scale label. Then click [Plot], 
and the result is displayed in the 2D plotting area as shown in the figure.

====================
Plot-¡¾Projected Band¡¿
====================
[Plot]-[Projected Bands] Then select the [PROCAR _CdCl] file in the [examples] folder, 
and input the relevant parameters in the dialog.
Enter the Fermi energy level of -3.0637eV; the number of high symmetry points is 3; 
radius scaling because the radius of each small circle represented in the graph, enter 150; 
enter the minimum maximum value of the Y-axis; 
the horizontal coordinate scaling factor indicates the number of points that can be drawn on each strip, 
which determines the speed of drawing the graph, if each strip can carry 180 points, 
when the input is 2, only 90 points will be drawn at intervals, 
which can be entered when the data is larger You can enter a larger value when the data is larger to observe the whole; 
for the track selection, you just need to check the checkbox of the atomic track you want to draw, 
and you can click to modify the color of the track.

====================
Plot-¡¾DOS¡¿
====================
[Plot]-[DOS] Then select the [DOSCAR] file in the [examples] folder, 
and input the relevant parameters in the dialog. 
You just need to check the checkbox of the track you want to select.

.. image:: images/12.jpg

====================
Plot-¡¾CHGCAR 2D¡¿
====================
[Plot]-[ CHGCAR 2D] Then select the [CHGCAR] file in the [examples] folder, 
and input the relevant parameters in the dialog.
Just select a plane, which will be displayed in the 3D drawing area. 

.. image:: images/13.jpg

.. image:: images/14.jpg

====================
Plot-¡¾CHGCAR 3D¡¿
====================
[Plot]-[ CHGCAR 2D] Then select the [CHGCAR] file in the [examples] folder, 
and input the relevant parameters in the dialog.
Just plot, which will be displayed in the 3D drawing area. 

.. image:: images/15.jpg

====================
Tool-¡¾Supercell¡¿
====================
After opening a POSCAR file, you can expand in x, y, and z directions.
After opening [examples] - [POSCAR], click [supercell] and enter the parameters in dialog a(x), 
b(y) and c(z) are 4, 3 and 2 respectively, and the result of cell expansion is shown in the figure.

====================
Settings-¡¾Node Connection¡¿
====================
There are two node connection modes, one is to jump to the node, and the other is not. 
When we do not check the check box to do not need to jump to the node mode, 
the jump node information can¡¯t be input at this time, enter the remote node ip, 
user name, password, path information, 
the local path defaults to the desktop to generate the [VASP_files] folder. 
When we check the checkbox to switch to the node mode, in addition to the remote node information, 
we also need to enter the ip, user name, password, and path information of the jump node. 
The local path will generate the [VASP_files] folder by default on the desktop. 
In order to avoid the need to manually enter each node connection, 
you can save the node information in [node_information.txt], 
and click [Get ip info] in the dialog to automatically obtain the information.
